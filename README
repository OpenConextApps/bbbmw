-- BigBlueButton Middleware --
The following components are required:

- PHP 5.3.x
- Smarty (PHP template engine)

The following components are optional:

- simpleSAMLphp (if you want to use SSPAuth for authenticating)

SVN:EXTERNALS is used to pull in an OAuth client for ConextGroups and Smarty.

For simpleSAMLphp a system wide installation is recommended. See 
docs/SURFconext.txt for more information on configuring simpleSAMLphp
for use with SURFconext, other identity federations will differ 
somewhat in configuration!

--- Configure ---

Run 

$ docs/configure.sh

If you want to use ConextGroupsOAuth2 run the following to initialize the
database:

$ php docs/init_oauth_db.php

Modify config.php and modify it. Set at least the URL to the BigBlueButton 
API and the salt as configured in BBB.

If you want to use a simple test configuration with plain username/password
authentication use SimpleAuth and SimpleGroups and configure them in 
config.php.

--- SELinux Configuration ---
Set the correct SELinux labels (only for Fedora/Red Hat systems?)

$ chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t data/ tpl_c/

Allow HTTP to access the network (to contact BBB)

$ su -c 'setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on'

(The -P flag makes the setting persistent across reboots)
